  Project Information:

-	Project title: Crawler to collect privacy policies, collect, store, archive

-	Problem statement: Understanding and keeping an eye on website privacy policies is essential in a time when digital privacy is of the utmost importance. However, individuals, organizations, and researchers looking to analyze these policies over time face a great challenge due to the sheer volume of online platforms and the dynamic nature of their privacy policies. The inability to maintain a centralized repository for privacy policies makes it more difficult to compare practices, keep track of changes, and carry out extensive analyses.

-	Objective: To create a crawler system that uses Elasticsearch for data storage and Python for website crawling that automatically gathers, stores, and archives privacy policies from a variety of websites. By filling in the lack of easily accessible, organized, and historical privacy policy data, this system will facilitate the effective retrieval and analysis of privacy policies over time.

-	Short description of project history and evolution: This project came to light as Tools that can assist stakeholders in monitoring and analyzing privacy practices across the digital landscape are desperately needed, as global scrutiny of data protection and privacy laws is growing. The goal of this project is to provide a solution that will enable researchers, legal analysts, and the public to remain vigilant and knowledgeable about digital privacy.
