Crawler to collect privacy policies, collect, store, archive
  Project Information:

-	Project title: Crawler to collect privacy policies, collect, store, archive

-	Problem statement: Understanding and keeping an eye on website privacy policies is essential in a time when digital privacy is of the utmost importance. However, individuals, organizations, and researchers looking to analyze these policies over time face a great challenge due to the sheer volume of online platforms and the dynamic nature of their privacy policies. The inability to maintain a centralized repository for privacy policies makes it more difficult to compare practices, keep track of changes, and carry out extensive analyses.

-	Objective: To create a crawler system that uses Elasticsearch for data storage and Python for website crawling that automatically gathers, stores, and archives privacy policies from a variety of websites. By filling in the lack of easily accessible, organized, and historical privacy policy data, this system will facilitate the effective retrieval and analysis of privacy policies over time.

-	Short description of project history and evolution: This project came to light as Tools that can assist stakeholders in monitoring and analyzing privacy practices across the digital landscape are desperately needed, as global scrutiny of data protection and privacy laws is growing. The goal of this project is to provide a solution that will enable researchers, legal analysts, and the public to remain vigilant and knowledgeable about digital privacy.
  
-	This README will guide you through setting up the development environment, installing the necessary dependencies, and getting the project up and running. Please follow below steps carefully to ensure a smooth setup.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Conda installed on your machine. Conda is an open-source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. If you don't have Conda installed, visit the [official Conda installation guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) to get started.

### 1. Clone the Project Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone <repository-url>

Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of the project repository.

### 2. Create a Conda Environment

Navigate to the project directory and create a new Conda environment named privacy_crawler with Python version 3.10 by running the following command:

conda create --name privacy_crawler python=3.10

### 3. Activate the Conda Environment

Once the environment is created, activate it using the command below:

conda activate privacy_crawler

### 4. Install Required Libraries

With the privacy_crawler environment activated, install the required libraries specified in the requirements.txt file by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 5. Start Elasticsearch

Before running the crawler, ensure that Elasticsearch is running. Elasticsearch can be started depending on your installation method. Generally, if you have installed Elasticsearch as a service, you can start it using your system's service management commands. If you're unsure, refer to the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/start-stop.html) for detailed instructions.

### 6. Run the Crawler

With all dependencies installed and Elasticsearch running, you can now run the crawler. Execute the script by running:

python scrapper.py

Ensure you're in the project's root directory and your privacy_crawler environment is activated.

### 7. Monitor the Crawler

As the crawler runs, monitor its progress through the terminal. The script's output will provide insights into the crawling process, including any errors or logs specified within the script.

### 8. Explore the Data

Once the crawler has finished its execution, you can explore the data indexed in Elasticsearch. Use Elasticsearch's query API or Kibana to analyze and visualize the crawled data.

### 9. Deactivate the Conda Environment

After you're done working on the project, deactivate the privacy_crawler environment to return to your base environment:

conda deactivate

### 10. Additional Resources

For more information on managing Conda environments, refer to the [Conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). For detailed Elasticsearch queries and operations, consult the [Elasticsearch reference documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html).
